I'm originally from the U.K. but back in the eighties we had some guests from Finland. They brought me a vinyl pop record now long lost. I can remember the tune and think it was about a haunted house? Maybe? My Google skills are not adequate and i can't find it anywhere. 

Any one have suggestions to scratch this annoying itch for me please?

Thanks.


I'm into tiny tattoos, and I would like to get some for cheap. I know the risks of getting tattoos from sketchy shops, but I just can't help it. I want tattoos now and I'm broke lol.

Hi dear people,

I am going to study in Finland from the next semester. Do you have any awesome life hack and tips for living in Tampere? Or any good advice about the city for an erasmus student? 

I am from Hungary.

KiitosðŸ’™

Maybe it's just me being an introverted American, but I wonder if any of you want to be alone for long periods of time sometimes?
Hi!  


I have heard that it is possible to do a technical inspection for a Finnish car in Tallinn? Has anyone ever heard about that? The person who told me that could not give me any more details.   


I have tried to google it but no real info came up in English.   


Thanks!
For anyone who had taken UAS (AMK) exams, I think they started to announce UAS admission results. I just received 2 emails an hour ago, also one in the morning. I got accepted into Metropolia, Savonia and Laurea for now. Metropolia was my first preference so I am happy with the results even though there are 3 more left. I hope everyone gets their admission results as they want and as quickly as possible :)
I came across my first Finnish music (Ota Varovasti by Vesta) a few days back and have been quite addicted to it. Want to dive into Finnish music.  
Any genre recommendations are welcome :)
I have some papers I must sign before closing on a home meeting tomorrow. OP sent me some documents on Monday afternoon for me to sign. The bank agent includes several things in the documents that we didn't agree such as:

1. No ASP bonus. We agreed in a message in the OP app that I will have an ASP bonus (4%) even with my normal loan. Though now she just sent me a message I won't have an ASP bonus for this loan.
2. A different number for the bank service fee. The service fee is 300â‚¬ as agreed in my loan promise. In the document, it is 400â‚¬.

It always takes the bank agent at least one day to reply to my message even if I reply really fast. Every time I called OP customer service, they told me the bank agent would try to call me asap. Though the bank agent never called me. They always sent 1 message, I replied and waited again. Now, the bank agent told me that I need to sign the papers before the meeting tomorrow. Otherwise, the home sales won't happen. Hence, I need to pay the 4% penalty to the home seller.

What should I do at the moment? I feel like OP bank is doing a bad job, but there's nothing I can do. As I don't want to pay the 4% penalty to the home seller.
Hi folks, the apartment search continues. I was evaluating apartments from different years and of course most of the available ones are from before the 90s and so it requires asbestos survey for each renovation that you do.

Let's assume that you want to renovate the kitchen, they run the survey and find that it has asbestos. How much would one expect as a general rule to increase the price of such renovation? Are we talking about 10% more? 20%?
So I was working for a small company here in Finland last year, I always received salary from them and everything  but after 5 months working there I stopped receiving payslips. As in the paperwork for my salary and employment. I mentioned this to my boss at the time and he got stingy about it and so it led to me resigning. Now I just got my Tax report... And a few months of employment are missing from there, so he has not been declaring my income to the income registry or my taxes. This is problematic for me since I'm a foreigner and and I have no issues cheating on the tax authorities from my country of origin but I don't want to fuck with the tax authorities in Finland, I want to pay my taxes and contribute what I owe to the system. I had a contract with him, I was not working as a contractor.

As things stand currently I am supposed to get 2000 bucks from the tax office as a repayment in august and I don't feel too good about it. Can someone tell me what to do? how to report this? how to seek help without it costing me a fortune?
Hello! I am going to take an exam in Lukio (I am not from Finland, i.e. a foreigner). Do exams have the same structure in Finland? If the oral part will be a support letter of motivation What will be in the written part?Thanks for the replies/suggestions!



Terve, I'm looking for a Catholic churches around Helsinki Area for a friend who's Catholic Christian, Any where that I can find one ? 

Kiitos kaikille.
Hey fellow redditors,

In your opinion, what should I look at when trying to buy property managed by a *taloyhtiÃ¶*?

I have a property in mind, but it seems that the *isÃ¤nnÃ¶itsijÃ¤* has changed frequently (every two years).

Is this bad/good/common?

Thanks y'all!
US citizen in Helsinki here. In the US Iâ€™ve used a number of carriers, setting up voicemail is as easy as going to the phone app>voicemail>setup

When I try that while Iâ€™m using Elisa, it has me enter my number. Then it says voicemail is not set up for this number and hangs up.   

Any suggestions? I hate missing a call and having no idea who the caller is or what they wanted. Iâ€™m applying to jobs currently so every missed call could be a potential lead!
As the titel already says, my girlfriend and I want to visit a shooting range but don't have an idea where to find a good one. I found LapinmÃ¤en ampurata on google and it seems promising, but I get the vibe you gotta bring your own gun (we don't own any guns)

Does anyone of you have an idea or experience with a shooting range near Vaasa? One where you can lend a gun and try it.

Hi!

I've never had an omakotitalo, but I'm considering buying one. However, I don't want to deal with all the potential maintenance work myself. In my country of origin if you have a house you have to deal with all the renovations and repairs yourself or at least carefully plan those and hire workers which you'll need to constantly keep an eye on.

Is the situation similar here in Suomi? I've seen lots and lots of beautiful private houses in perfect condition, some of which are run by elderly people and I'm a bit confused.
Hey, im a My Summer Car (game is set in 1995, Finland) player who want to make playlist that will be realistic according to 90s popculture in Finland. Which genres typical Finnish teenagers have listened on their walkman?

Hey! I keep asking questions about Finland. This time I thought about the iconic holidays of the country of a thousand lakes. It would be great if you not only named the iconic holidays, but also described how Finns celebrate them. (Don't talk about Christmas, that's the only thing I know :)). Thanks in advance for your answers!
